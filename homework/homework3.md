AcademiX is a Debian based Linux distribution designed explicitly for education purposes. It comes bundled with free, open-source teaching and learning software to use for primary education to the university level. The EDU package manager provides you with one large pool where you can find and install all the educational software you might need.I would use Firefox as the web browser and I will add the FoxFilter; FoxFilter helps block content for essentially any user-defined Web site or criteria. You can quickly and easily block content for an entire site. FireFilter OpenDNS offers a free version. Their 'deluxe' version is $9.95 per year, so that is not free, but it is a great price.
