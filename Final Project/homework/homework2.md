## Question 1: What are the advantages of open source?
1. Since Linux and open source solutions are easily portable and compressed, it takes lesser hardware power to carry out the same tasks when compared to the hardware power it takes on servers, such as, Solaris
2. Open source software is mostly high-quality software. When you use the open source software, the source code is available.
3. IT managers in organizations face constant frustration when dealing with vendor lock-ins'. Lack of portability, expensive license fees and inability to customize software are some of the other disadvantages.
4. By using open source software, you can benefit from integrated management. Open source software uses technologies, such as, common information model (CIM) and web based enterprise management (WBEM). These high-end technologies enable you to integrate and combine server, application, service and workstation management.
5. you will get ample support when you use open source software. Open source support is mostly freely available and can be easily accessed through online communities.
6. Using open source software can help you minimize your expenses. You can save on licensing fees and maintenance fees.

## Question 2: What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
1. The Freedom to Run. The first tenet of software freedom is the user's fully unfettered right to run the program.
2. The Freedom to Change and Modify.
3. The Freedom to Copy and Share. 
4. The Freedom to Share Improvements.

## Question 3: Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
So, a proprietary software is when someone develops a software and decides not to share the source code with others. FOSS (free open source software) is when someone develops a software and makes the source code available for public domain without restrictions. According to Richard Stallman, a free software allows the user to control the program, whereas a closed source software is where is the user is controlled by the program. I think that a free software is fair to the user. The user should have the freedom to run the program for any purpose, the freedom to study and change the source code, the freedom to make and distribute copies of the program, and the freedom to distribute the modified copies (Stallman, Richard)

## Question 4:
I agree with Richard Stallman. He is explaining why open source is better than a closed source. It is 100% true that the user needs to have the 4 freedoms. I agree that I should be the one in control of my device and not be controlled by it. Also, I believe in what my that Luis Guzmanâ€™s right to repair is something we should be able to fight for. We need to be able to fix our own devices; if I own that phone, I should have the freedom to do whatever I want with it. However, I believe that closed source is not that bad at the end; not all the programs have to be FOSS. For example, Video games must be closed source because if users got the codes, they will be able to create their own versions; they only need to acknowledge the inventor of the game. I think that open source and closed source can coexist.
